title: About
---

I started out as a tech writer at National Instruments Corporation in Austin, Texas, where I documented hardware systems and software features from 2009-2012. After gaining a solid foundation in the profession and receiving a promotion, I left to teach in South Korea, and I didn't come back for six years.

I've held a number of writing-centric positions in the interim, including:

- Writing instructor at the elementary, middle, high school, and university levels
- Technical Editor for the textbook series Kong and Park
- Director of Communications for the architecture firm Plural Office

Now I'm returning to my roots in tech, and it feels good.
