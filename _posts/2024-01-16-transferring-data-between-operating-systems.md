When there's more than one way to complete the same task, users need to know the pros and cons of each method. I designed the follow table to help users choose between the various options for transferring data between operating systems on their NI Real-Time Hypervisor system. The full manual is [still available](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/372833c/page/download.html) but archived on NI's site.

To see a similar topic that's still live, check out [Choosing a Method of Reading and Writing Shared Variables](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/labview/page/choosing-a-method-of-reading-and-writing-shared-variables.html).
