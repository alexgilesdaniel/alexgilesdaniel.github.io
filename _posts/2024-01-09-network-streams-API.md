As I wrote in the docs, "a network stream is a lossless, unidirectional, one-to-one communication channel that consists of a writer and a reader endpoint."[^1] The API was designed for network data transfer between applications developed with NI's graphical programming environment LabVIEW, and the docs I wrote are still available at the links below.

[^1]: Quoted verbatim from the introductory topic for the API. I joined on with NI just when development for this API was beginning, so I wrote the first iteration of the docs, and the content has largely, if not entirely, remained the same.
