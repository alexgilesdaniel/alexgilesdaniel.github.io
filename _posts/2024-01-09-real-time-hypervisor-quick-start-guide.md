The first product I took charge of documenting at National Instruments was the NI Real-Time Hypervisor, a bare metal embedded system that could simultaneously run and transfer data between multiple operating systems over a virtual Ethernet connection or shared memory.

One of my first tasks was to write installation instructions for the Linux version of the system. I first installed the components of the system in a chassis, and then I followed developer instructions to set up the Linux version of the system. Those instructions weren't comprehensive, so as I tested the procedure, I documented every step.

Excerpts of that work, which appeared in a PDF quick start guide along with the product, appear below. Aside from the clarity of my writing, these samples demonstrate my experience with both Linux and working on the command line.

[^3]: this is another footnote.
[^4]: this is a very very long footnote to test if a very very long footnote brings some problems or not; hope that there are no problems but you know sometimes problems arise from nowhere.
