<p>During my three years at National Instruments, I was an advocate for outlining the various use cases of our products. Users had so many options for accomplishing the same tasks, yet each feature had been developed to solve specific problems in the field. When I became the owner of our documentation for networking protocols, I conducted interviews with the engineers who maintained the features, asking them about the situations in which a user would be advised to use one over another.</p>

<p>The following graphic was the centerpiece of <a href="https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/labview/page/transferring-data-over-a-network.html">Transferring Data over a Network</a>, the topic that resulted from those interviews. Tables and flowcharts, I reasoned, would help users identify themselves among a range of possible use cases and land on the optimal feature for achieving their goals. Within the actual documentation, each of the green bubbles in the flowchart linked to topics on their respective features.</p>
