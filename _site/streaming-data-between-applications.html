<p>One of my proudest accomplishments at National Instruments was developing a multimodal approach to documentation. Prior to my joining on with NI, the LabVIEW documentation contained screenshots of programming examples, but they were few, and the team didn’t have a standardized format for explaining them in detail. In my documentation, I used numbered callouts to describe the flow of data through LabVIEW applications, as seen in the adapted excerpt below.</p>

<p>Read the full topic <a href="https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/labview/page/streaming-data-between-applications.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="streaming-data-between-applications">Streaming Data between Applications</h2>

<p>The following figure shows an example of using the Network Streams functions to stream data between two applications on different computers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/NS_streaming data.gif" alt="Network Streams Programming Example" /></p>

<p>The following events occur in the previous figure.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Create Network Stream Writer Endpoint function creates a writer endpoint on Computer 1, and the Create Network Stream Reader Endpoint function creates a reader endpoint on Computer 2.</li>
  <li>The writer endpoint establishes a connection with the reader endpoint using the endpoint URL of the reader endpoint.</li>
  <li>Within the Writer Loop, the Write Single Element to Stream function continuously writes the value of the iteration i terminal of the While Loop to the stream.</li>
  <li>Within the Reader Loop, the Read Single Element from Stream function continuously reads the stream.</li>
  <li>Data streams continuously until the user clicks the Stop button on Computer 1.</li>
  <li>The Flush Stream function transfers all remaining data to the reader endpoint.</li>
  <li>The Destroy Stream Endpoint function destroys the writer endpoint.</li>
  <li>The reader endpoint receives an error due to disconnection, and data flow exits the While Loop.</li>
  <li>The Destroy Stream Endpoint function destroys the reader endpoint, which destroys the stream.</li>
</ol>
